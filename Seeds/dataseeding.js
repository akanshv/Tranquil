She was like we should mantain distance and i said i am already doing that. Just leave. and walked out. Now this girl for some reason is trying to hurt or insult me for some revenge by showing me that she is really happy with her friends whom she chose. But everyone has noticed that to show that she is faking her happiness too much. So when she purposely tried on me i started talking to other girls in front her and she left with her friends. Why she wants this revenge after she said wants to mantain distance?',

Not just one person but the whole class never liked me. I was very alone that time. I do not feel like sharing it to my parents also because they also do not take me seriously. Whenever it came to mental health my parents never took me seriously. They called me mad. They never realized what is causing me to think too much.. Today I work in corporate I dont have a single friend because I do not like people. I think they make fun of me, they do not like me.. I feel lonely because of that. My confidence is so broken.. I do not feel happy with myself. I need a friend who is polite to me, who do not judge me with whom I can share things freely.',
